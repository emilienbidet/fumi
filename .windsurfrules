# Fumi PDF Server Framework

## Project Overview

Fumi is a Bun-powered PDF generation server framework using React for templating. 
It provides a simple, type-safe way to create PDF server with React components.

## Code Style Guidelines

### General Principles

1. Follow SOLID principles strictly:
   - Single Responsibility: Each class/module handles one specific concern
   - Open/Closed: Extend functionality through plugins/middlewares
   - Liskov Substitution: Router implementations must be interchangeable
   - Interface Segregation: Keep interfaces focused and minimal
   - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not implementations

2. TypeScript Usage:
   - Use strict type checking
   - Document all public interfaces with TSDoc comments
   - Define and export types for all public APIs
